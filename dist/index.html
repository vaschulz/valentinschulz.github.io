        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I am a professional Mechanical Engineer and Software Developer by passion.
          I love to master coding challenges from front-end to back-end.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to enable myself for a career in software development or web design. 
          My primary goal now is to gather as much practical coding experience as possible 
          and to fill my portfolio with my first projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Born and raised in Berlin. During my last years in highschool my interest in astronomics, 
          coding and physics awakened. After graduating, I studied Mechanical Engineering with a focus on design,
           life science and manufacturing. Parallely, my interest in coding and software began to grow and I decided
           to pursue this passion in my free time to supplement my engineering expertise. Now I strife to lift my coding skills to the next level.
